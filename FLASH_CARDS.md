  + `ACCESS METHOD`
 
*The MAC (Media Access Control) sublayer is a part of the Data Link Layer in the OSI model, specifically dealing with how devices on a network gain access to the network medium. The "access method" refers to the rules and procedures that determine which device gets to transmit data at any given time, preventing collisions and ensuring orderly communication. Different network types use different access methods; for example, Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) in older versions and CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) in wireless networks.*

+ WHAT LAYER DOES `EAPOL` OPERATE?

  + `LAYER 2 (DATA LINK LAYER)`
 
*EAPOL, or Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN, is a protocol used to provide a secure method of authentication to a network before a user is allowed access. Because it operates directly over the LAN infrastructure, it resides at Layer 2 of the OSI model, the Data Link Layer. This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer between two directly connected nodes.*

  + `FILTERED OUT`
 
*A SYN scan is a type of network scanning technique used to determine the state of a port on a target system. It works by sending SYN (synchronize) packets to the target port. The response to these packets indicates whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.*

*When a SYN packet is sent to an open port, the target system responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, indicating that it is ready to establish a connection. If the port is closed, the target system responds with an RST (reset) packet, indicating that the connection is refused. However, if there is no response to the SYN packet, it suggests that the packets are being filtered out, likely by a firewall or other security device, preventing them from reaching the target port.*

+ SWITCHES STORE THE __ OF EVERY CONNECTED DEVICE IN A CAM TABLE.

  + `LAYER 2 ADDRESS`

*Switches operate at `Layer 2` of the OSI model, also known as the `Data Link Layer`. At this layer, devices are identified by their MAC addresses, which are unique hardware addresses. Switches use these MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination within the network.*

*A `CAM (Content Addressable Memory)` table is a special type of memory that switches use to quickly look up the MAC address associated with each port. When a switch receives a frame, it checks the destination MAC address against its CAM table. If a match is found, the switch forwards the frame only to the port associated with that MAC address, which reduces network congestion and improves performance. If the destination MAC address is not in the CAM table, the switch floods the frame to all ports (except the one it received the frame on) in a process called unknown unicast flooding. The switch also updates its CAM table by recording the source MAC address and the port it was received on, allowing it to learn the network topology over time.*

+ WHAT ABILITIES DOES `SNMP` (SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL) HAVE?

  + `MONITOR NETWORK DEVICE STATUS, REMOTELY CONFIGURE DEVICES, SET UP "TRAPS" TO SEND NOTIFICATIONS TO A CENTRAL SERVER WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR.`
 
*SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol designed for network management. It allows administrators to monitor the status of network devices like routers, switches, servers, and printers. Beyond just monitoring, SNMP also provides the ability to configure these devices remotely, changing settings and parameters as needed. A key feature of SNMP is the use of "traps," which are notifications sent by devices to a central server when certain events occur, such as a device going offline or exceeding a threshold. This proactive alerting helps in quickly identifying and resolving network issues.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ IF YOU NEED TO SUPPORT WINDOWS CLIENTS USING UNIX SERVERS, YOU WILL PROBABLY USE?

  + `SAMBA`
 
*`Samba` is a suite of applications that implements the `Server Message Block (SMB) protocol` on Unix-like systems, allowing them to share files and printers with Windows-based computers. `Windows uses SMB for network file sharing`, so `Samba` acts as a `bridge`, enabling seamless integration between Windows clients and Unix servers. Without Samba or a similar solution, Windows machines would not be able to easily access resources hosted on Unix servers.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ WHAT IS ANOTHER TERM FOR SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION?

  + `SINGLE-KEY ENCRYPTION`
 
*Symmetric encryption is called `single-key` encryption because the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data. This is in contrast to asymmetric encryption, where one key encrypts and a different key decrypts.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ 802.1D IS ____ AND IS LAYER 2 OF THE OSI MODEL.

  + `SPANNIN TREE PROTOCOL (STP)`
 
*The `IEEE 802.1D standard` defines the `Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)`. STP is a network protocol that `prevents loops` in a network topology. It operates at `Layer 2 (the Data Link Layer)` of the OSI model. By implementing STP, network administrators can ensure a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks, which is crucial for maintaining network stability and `preventing broadcast storms`.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ WHAT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE?

  + `ADDRESSES ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPUTERS OPERATION`
 
*The `KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` hive in the Windows Registry contains configuration information about the computer itself, rather than the user. This includes hardware, software, and operating system settings that apply to all users of the computer. It's a crucial part of the registry because it dictates how the system behaves. For example, it stores device drivers, system services, and security settings. Modifying this hive often requires administrative privileges and can have system-wide effects.*

<br>
<br>

+ IN UNIX, WHAT COMMAND CAN "FIND AND REPLACE" TEXT?

  + `sed`
 
*The `sed` command in UNIX is a powerful tool for performing text manipulations, including finding and replacing text within files or input streams. It operates based on regular expressions, allowing for flexible and complex pattern matching. For example, you can use `sed` to replace all occurrences of a specific word in a file, or to substitute a pattern with a different string based on certain conditions. The basic syntax involves specifying the substitution command `s`, followed by the pattern to find, the replacement text, and optional flags to control the behavior of the command.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ IN WINDOWS, WHAT COMMAND WOULD YOU USE TO SHARE A FOLDER WITH SOMEONE?

  + `net share`
 
*The `net share` command in Windows is used to manage shared resources on a network. It allows you to share folders or printers, making them accessible to other users on the network. The basic syntax is `net share <sharename>=<drive:path>`. For example, to share a folder named "Data" located at "C:\Data" with the share name "DataShare", you would use the command `net share DataShare=C:\Data`. You can also add options to control permissions and access.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ In UNIX, what does the `whereis` command return?

  + `THE ABSOLUTE PATH OF A BINARY`
 
*The whereis command in UNIX is a quick way to locate the binary, source code, and manual page files for a specific command. For example, if you type whereis ls, it will show you where the ls executable is located (e.g., /bin/ls), as well as the locations of its source file (if available) and its manual page. This is helpful for understanding where programs are installed and for accessing their documentation.*

  + `PATH HOLDS THE DIRECTORIES IN WHICH THE OPERATING SYSTEM LOOKS FOR THE COMMANDS YOU EXECUTE AT THE COMMAND LINE`
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ IN UNIX, WHAT DOES THE `file` COMMAND DO?

  + `IDENTIFIES THE FILE TYPE BY LOOKING INSIDE THE FILE AT THE FILE HEADER, NOT THE FILE EXTENSION`
 
*The `file` command in UNIX is a utility used to determine the type of a file. Unlike some operating systems that rely heavily on file extensions to identify file types, file examines the file's content, specifically the `magic number` or `file header`. This header contains information about the file's structure and format, allowing file to accurately identify the file type, regardless of its extension (or lack thereof). This is more reliable than depending on the file extension, which can be easily changed or omitted.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ WHAT DOES THE WHO COMMAND DO IN UNIX?

  + `READS THE /var/log/utmp FILE AND REVEALS ACTIVE USER SESSIONS`
 
*The `who` command is a basic Unix command that displays information about currently logged-in users. It retrieves this information by reading the `/var/log/utmp` file, which keeps track of user login sessions. The output typically includes the `username, terminal line, login time, and sometimes the remote host from which the user is connected`. It's a quick way to see who is currently using the system.*

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

+ IN UNIX WHAT IS THE `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file?

  + `THE ORDER IN WHICH TO CONTACT DIFFERENT NAME SERVICES`
 
*The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file is a configuration file that specifies the order in which the system should consult various naming and directory services to resolve names and other information. This includes things like hostnames, user accounts, groups, and services. The file allows administrators to customize the sources and the order in which they are queried, providing flexibility in managing how a system resolves names and retrieves information from different databases or services. `For example, you can specify whether the system should first check the local /etc/hosts file before querying a DNS server for hostname resolution.`*
